J2EE
-------------------
1. J2SE/ Java SE --- Fundamentals of java require.--> OOPs, EH, Packages, MT, Collections, JDBC,
                     RMI(remote method invocation)


2. J2EE/ Java EE --- Server side development.. need EE.(Client server architecture).
    technologies
    1. Component based technologies.
        1.Web component based technologies
           1.Servlets, JSP, JSF, JSTL, Expression language.

        2.Distributed component base technologies.
            1.EJBs, CORBA, Web Services...

        3. XML component based technologies.
            1.JAX-P(java api for xml parsing), JAX-B(binding), JAX-RPC(remote procedure calls), ......

    2. Service Oriented technologies
       JNDI(java naming and directory interface), JTA(transaction api), JCA(connector), JAAS(authentication & authorize), JMS(messaging service).

    3. Protocol based technologies.
        1. Web services, RMI, OMG(object management), HttpServlet.



ADV Java Topics--------------------------------------------------------------->
Pre-req. for JDBC[core java]
  static input, dynamic input, command line input
    1.Dynamic input Approaches(runtime)----------------------->
        1.By using BufferedReader
          readLine()
          read()

        2.By using Scanner
           make object, call direct primitive like nextInt(), nextLine() etc.
        3.By using console
           Disadvantages of br and scanner
            --> two line of code for single scan.
                lengthy code
          
          Console c=System.console();
           package--> java.io;

           username in String, password in char array,


    2.Class.forName() and newInstance() methods.
    3.Static keyword
        will improve sharability in java application.
        We are able to utilize static keyword in four ways.
          1. Static variables.
            
            >While execution of programme, jvm load main class byte code to the memory.
            >static variables are recognized and initialized at the time of respctive class bytecode to the memory.
            
            >static var. are accesse by tho ways
              1. by using class name
              2. by using respective class reference variables.

            >static variables will provide single value to all the objects.
            >static variable never be local variables.

            >must be declared as class level variables.
            
            Suggestable is -----------> Access by class name



          2.Static methods// for jdbc
            >recognize and execute at the moment , when we access that method.
            >Access by class name or reference variable.
            >allow only static variables, will not allow non static members of current class.
            
            >Note-->If want to access non static var. in static method, create object and use.

            >this keyword not allowed in static method.

            >


          3.Static blocks// for jdbc
  



    4.FileOutput stream and fileinputStream
    5.Collections
    6.Properties file.
