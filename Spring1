1.Introduction
   What is the need of frameworks?
    >to prepare and simplify enterprise application.
     Enterprise: It is a business organization, It is a group of organization running under single label.
     Enterprise application: It is a software application design for an enterprise, 
     It will simplify internal business processing.
    

For any enterprise application we need to provide three layers.
 1.Presentation layer / User interface layer------> 1.Starting point to access our application.
                                                    2.Login pages, It will look and feel to the enterprise application.
                                                    3.It will take data from user inorder to submit to enterprise appli.
                                                    4.Data validation(ex. date,time syntax check.)
                                                      data validation-->Client side(validate on client mac.-->check id and p/w typed or not), server side(After login check data is valid or not.)
                                                    In client side validation , need to use Javascript functions.
                                                    In server side we need java validation java code is sufficient, by validation api.
                                                    5.Types of request submit from client to server, http--7
